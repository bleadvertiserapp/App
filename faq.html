                        <p>BLE Advertiser is an advanced Android application that turns your phone into a Bluetooth Low
                            Energy (BLE) peripheral simulator. You can create custom BLE advertisement profiles,
                            broadcast them, and test BLE scanners and IoT firmware — all without any extra hardware.</p>

                        <p>BLE Advertiser works on most modern Android devices. However, not all devices support BLE
                            peripheral mode (advertising). The app will check your device's capabilities at startup and
                            let you know which features are available. Extended advertising (BLE 5.0) requires newer
                            hardware.</p>

                        <p>Extended advertising requires BLE 5.0 hardware support. While your phone may advertise BLE
                            5.0, the actual Bluetooth chipset may not support all BLE 5.0 features. This is a hardware
                            limitation and cannot be resolved via software. You can check your device's BLE capabilities
                            on the app's Device Info screen.</p>
